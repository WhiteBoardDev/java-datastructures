/**
 * Gets the common elements between two arrays. No duplicates are returned in the output
 * 
 * There are two primary approaches to complete this task, each one has its own benefits and drawbacks
 * 
 * 1. Sort arrays up front then iterate through. Assuming Avg case quickstort O(n log n) for sorting then O(n) for 
 *      iterating through the arrays. Data remains in place and does not need to be copied so this approach is easy
 *      on memory
 * 2. Place elements from smallest array in a hashmap. Then iterate over the larger array and see if elements exist
 *      in the map
 *      
 * This is the first approach which is easy on memory but a little more difficult for runtime   
 *   
 * 
 * Runtime: O(n log n )
